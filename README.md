# CAMERA2
It is an upgrade with the DR specification of the optical sensor I have received 10th of june 2025.

I have designed the camera around the piece of metal "cache4", with the software autodesk FUSION, in order to complete my project.

Then it should be manufactured with the mechanical drawing, and the pieces of metal can be made at the website "www.usineur.fr".

BR, EO.

PS :  To solder the components you also need to buy capacitors and resistors, for example on the "www.mchobby.be" website.

Here again, I do join the list of the electronical components for soldering on the printed circuit board :

9 Capacitors of 10nF 50V

9 Capacitors of 100nF 50V

9 Capacitors of 10µF AVX 16V

7 Capacitors of 1µF AVX 25V

2 Capacitors electrolytic of 10µF 25V

19 x 36 Pin Header Female (for the socket of the optical sensor)

1 x 40 Pin Header Male (for the arduino connector of the FPGA board)

2 x 25 Pin Header Male (for the parallel port of the circuit board)

7 Potentiometers of 1KOhms 3296W

1 Sensor MT9M413STMDR

1 DEL 3mm

1 Resistor 430Ohms

1 Resistor 2K2Ohms

1 Resistor 10KOhms

1 Transistor BC550B TO92 45V
