# CAMERA2
It is an upgrade with the DR specification of the optical sensor I have received 10th of june 2025.

I have designed the camera around the piece of metal "cache4", with the software autodesk FUSION, in order to complete my project.

Then it should be manufactured with the mechanical drawing, and the pieces of metal can be made at the website "www.usineur.fr".

BR, EO.
